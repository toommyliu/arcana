# arcana

finally, an AQW botting client specifically for macOS users (and works on Apple Silicon)

# compatibility

as long as you are using some modern verison of macOS, you'll probably be able to run the client. unfortunately, it does not run native [(yet)](https://github.com/toommyliu/arcana/pull/4).

# scripting

scripts will be implemented in lua via [fengari](https://fengari.io). the runtime is subpar is expected to be improved through various iterations.
