# arcana

finally, an AQW botting client for macOS (including Apple Silicon).

# compatibility

as long as you are using some modern verison of macOS, you'll probably be able to run the client. unfortunately, it does not run native [(yet)](https://github.com/toommyliu/arcana/pull/4).

# scripting

scripts will be implemented through lua via [fengari](https://fengari.io).
